## Design

### Imagery

All imagery used within the site has been chosen to showcase the catterys queens and kittens.
All images used belong to Willow Velvet Sphynx.

### Wireframes

### Typography

The following Google Fonts were used on this site:

- Philosopher is used for the headings on the site. This is a Sans Serif font.
- Open Sans is used for the main text of the site. This is a Sans Serif font.

### Colour Scheme

A shade of blue has been used as the primary colour for the site; other than the use of black and white, this will be the only colour used throughout the site. Blue has been used because, in terms of colour psychology, it symbolises trust and responsibility, which are important to the cattery. This shade of blue also passes all contrast test when checked against white which will be the colour used against it.

## Features

The website will include a home page, a page showcasing the queens with links to their own individual pages that will include images of their kittens, an FAQ page, and a contact page.
Each page will be responsive.

### Features on Each Page

- Each page consists of a navigation bar at the top, providing easy navigation around the site. The navigation bar is responsive and adjusts to the size of the viewport. On tablet sized devices and below, the navigation bar consists of the client logo to the left and a hamburg toggle button to the right, which provides a dropdown menu with links to each of the site's pages and the client's social platforms. On devices larger than a tablet, the logo no longer displays and is replaced with the client brand name to the left and to the right, the hamburg toggle button is replaced with a set of links to the site's pages.
- Each page will consist of a footer that includes the client's social platforms and another link to the contact page. Icons have been used because they are universally recognisable and they provide better design. The footer is responsive and adjusts to the size of the viewport.

#### Home Page

- The home page consists of a heading section, which includes the caterry's name or logo depending on the viewport size and information on when the cattery's next litter is due.
- Below the heading section is an 'about us' section, which provides the user with information about the cattery.
- The next section includes images of the cattery's adult cats. On small mobile devices, only one image will show; on tablet sized devices, two images will show; and on devices larger than a tablet, three images will show.
- All sections on the page are responsive.

## Testing

After the home page was complete, I ran both the HTML and CSS code on the W3C code validation service and confirmed there were no errors present.
