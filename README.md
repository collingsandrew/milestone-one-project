### Typography

The following Google Fonts were used on this site:

- Philosopher is used for the headings on the site. This is a Sans Serif font.

![Philosopher](assets/readme/fonts/philosopher.png)

- Open Sans is used for the main text of the site. This is a Sans Serif font.

![Open Sans](assets/readme/fonts/open-sans.png)

Both of these fonts look professional and are easy to read.

### Colour Scheme

A shade of blue has been used as the primary colour for the site; other than the use of black and white, this will be the only colour used throughout the site. Blue has been used because, in terms of colour psychology, it symbolises trust and responsibility, which are important to the cattery. This shade of blue also passes all contrast tests when checked against white, which will be the colour used against it.

## Bugs

### Fixed

- When adding the accordion to the FAQ page, there were gaps between each accordion item. This was happening because the h2 elements within the accordion button were inheriting the h2 styling from the CSS stylesheet. To fix this, I used specificity to focus on h2 elements that are a child of the 'accordion' class and removed the margins affecting them.

- When testing the deployed site on the Safari browser, the input submit button for the contact form was displaying differently than it was on other browsers. I wanted a consistent design throughout the site, so I changed the input element to a button element with the 'type' attribute as 'submit'. This enabled me to style the button in line with the design of the rest of the site and also stop the design from changing on different browsers.
