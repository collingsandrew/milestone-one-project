### Typography

The following Google Fonts were used on this site:

- Philosopher is used for the headings on the site. This is a Sans Serif font.
- Open Sans is used for the main text of the site. This is a Sans Serif font.

Both of these fonts look professional and are easy to read.

### Colour Scheme

A shade of blue has been used as the primary colour for the site; other than the use of black and white, this will be the only colour used throughout the site. Blue has been used because, in terms of colour psychology, it symbolises trust and responsibility, which are important to the cattery. This shade of blue also passes all contrast tests when checked against white which will be the colour used against it.

## Features

The website will include a home page, a page showcasing the queens with links to their own individual pages that will include images of their kittens, an FAQ page, and a contact page.
Each page will be responsive on all devices.

### Features on Each Page

- Each page consists of a navigation bar at the top, providing easy navigation around the site. The navigation bar is responsive and adjusts to the size of the viewport. On tablet-sized devices and below, the navigation bar consists of the client logo to the left and a hamburg toggle button to the right, which provides a dropdown menu with links to each of the site's pages and the client's social platforms. On devices larger than a tablet, the logo no longer displays and is replaced with the client brand name to the left and to the right, the hamburg toggle button is replaced with a set of links to the site's pages.
- Each page will consist of a footer that includes the client's social platforms and another link to the contact page. Icons have been used because they are universally recognisable and they provide better design. The footer is responsive and adjusts to the size of the viewport.

User stories covered: 5, 8

#### Home Page

- The home page consists of a heading section, which includes the caterry's name or logo depending on the viewport size and information on when the cattery's next litter is due.
- Below the heading section is an 'about us' section, which provides the user with information about the cattery.
- Below the About Us text are 3 cards, each consisting of an image, and a button that links to the Queens page, the FAQ page, and the contact page.
- All sections on the page are responsive.

#### Queens Page

- The queens page consists of a heading section, which includes the caterry's name or logo depending on the viewport size and the title of 'Our Queens'.

- Below the page text are 3 cards, each consisting of an image of each queen, the queen's name, and a button that links to their own dedicated page.
- All sections on the page are responsive, with the cards flowing in a column on mobile devices, a pyramid style on tablet-sized devices, and a row on devices larger than a tablet.

## Testing

### Home Page

After the home page was complete, I ran both the HTML and CSS code on the W3C code validation service and confirmed there were no errors present.
I have run Lighthouse through Google Dev Tools, and the scores the site gave were:

## Deployment

### Deploying the project

GitHub pages were used to deploy this project. The following steps explain how this is done:

1. When logged into GitHub, locate and access the [repository.](https://github.com/collingsandrew/milestone-one-project)
2. Click on the settings link that is located at the top of the repository.
3. Using the menu to the left, follow the pages link.
4. Here, we then need to make sure the source drop-down box is set to 'deploy from branch'.
5. Finally, we set the branch to 'main' and the folder to 'root', and then click save.

The page should then refresh, and the link to the deployed website should appear at the top of the page.

### Fork

Forking a project creates a completely seperate codebase and allows a user to make local changes to a project without affecting the original repository itself.

To fork the repository:

1. When logged into GitHub, locate and access the [repository.](https://github.com/collingsandrew/milestone-one-project)
2. At the top right of the repository, there will be a 'fork' option.

### Clone

Cloning a project allows a user to make contributions to the main repository, with permission.

To clone the repository:

1. When logged into GitHub, locate and access the [repository.](https://github.com/collingsandrew/milestone-one-project)
2. Above your files to the right, select the code drop down button and select either HTTPS, SSH or GitHub CLI and then copy the URL below.
3. Then, in your chosen code editor, change the current working directory to the location you would like the cloned repository.
4. In the terminal, type 'git clone' and paste the URL that you copied earlier and then press enter.

## Bugs

### Fixed

- When adding the accordion to the FAQ page, there were gaps between each accordion item. This was happening because the h2 elements within the accordion button were inheriting the h2 styling from the CSS stylesheet. To fix this, I used specificity to focus on h2 elements that are a child of the 'accordion' class and removed the margins affecting them.

Before:

After:

![Accordion Margins After](./assets/readme/bugs/accordion-bug-after.png)

- When testing the deployed site on the Safari browser, the input submit button for the contact form was displaying differently than it was on other browsers. I wanted a consistent design throughout the site, so I changed the input element to a button element with the 'type' attribute as 'submit'. This enabled me to style the button in line with the design of the rest of the site and also stop the design from changing on different browsers.
